heat-template-schema
====================

This npm module provides JSON schema for OpenStack Heat Orchestration Templates.
Currently it is mainly useful in Visual Studio Code with [YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adamvoss.yaml).

Ready to use schema is in `schema/heat-template.schema.json` file.

You can also generate your schema using `lib/download-resource-types.js` and `lib/resource-types-to-json-schema.js` scripts.
